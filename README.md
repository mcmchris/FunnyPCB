# FunnyPCB
This is my funny new Keychein for celebrating Halloween, designed on EasyEDA for a nice and professional build by https://www.JLCPCB.com

This keychain will be nice and easy for a great party mindblowing and stylish car/house keys partner.

In the back of the PCB where LED's are placed will be attached a 3D printed light difusor ring, so LED's light iluminate the transparency of the PCB. (Beige colored on 3D pictures).
